## Currently working on Project-2

## How to build and boot up

1. Modify the Makefile so that the paths of toolchains match those on your PC.

2. Use `make all` to create an image

3. Use `make run` to start u-boot

4. In u-boot, use `loadboot` to start Genshix

5. If you see the logo then all goes well!
